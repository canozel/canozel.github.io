# Personal Site built with Jekyll and Octopress

This repository hosts the source of my personal blog powered by **Jekyll** with the **Octopress** framework. Here I share travel stories, coding tutorials and showcase some of my applications.

## Install Dependencies

Use Bundler and npm to fetch the Ruby and Node packages required by the site:

```bash
bundle install
npm install
```

## Local Development

Run the Jekyll server to build the site and watch for changes:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Commit your changes and push them to the GitHub repository. GitHub Pages will automatically build the site and publish it live.
